# About this repo
  - This repo is where I put my LeetCode solutions in addition to other algorithms and data structures I've implemented.
  - For each LeetCode problem I may include multiple solutions, the higher the solution number, the better optimized it is.
  - I write all of my solutions in Python first as it is my strongest langauge and then I implement them again in C in attempt to become better with the language and observe the preformace differences.
